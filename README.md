## Unleash Your Inner Monkey

Welcome to the official repository of BananaTech™ - where we've revolutionized the way primates interact with technology! 

> **Note:** This is my creative implementation of The Odin Project's Landing Page assignment. The project required building a complete landing page from a design provided in the curriculum.
